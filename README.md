# conditional_ddpm_for_mri_synthesis
This repository contains the code for the project "Can DDPMs really beat GANson conditional medical image synthesis?" on the course CS236 - Deep Generative Models at Stanford. We acknowledge that with adaptations to the image synthesis task in MRI, the code is mainly based on the unofficial implementation of the [a link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07636.pdf) SR3 paper in https://github.com/Janspiry/Image-Super-Resolution-via-Iterative-Refinement
